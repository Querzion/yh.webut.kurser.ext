# yh.webut.kurser.ext
This is an extension of yh.webut.kurser, since the filepath's are too long in windows in regards to linux. This causes a problem so that one cannot clone the repo or extract the zip in Windows, regardless if long paths are enabled and extended filenames are enabled. So I'm starting an extension instead where I have the projects in the first folder.
